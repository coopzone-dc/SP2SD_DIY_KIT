This version of the software has been changed from 1.16 to allow you to rotate round the images without having to reset
between each change. Onece you have the correct image slot select, you only need to reset once.

If your using the Apple, to power the board, this reduced the number of times you have to power the computer on /off
In fact if you use the reset button on the Atmega board you can reset the Apple from the keyboard without needing to power cycle it at all.
